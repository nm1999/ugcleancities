                <b> Plastic control methods in the commmuunity</b>
                    <p>Currently, Industries  in Uganda produce  up to 600 metric tons of plastic waste a day and only about 6% of that waste is collected back  from the communities. (Planet Buyback, 2021). 
                        Plastic waste management practices in Uganda are still ineffective especially among the urban population yet these urban areas are hotspots for plastic wastes since urban consumers are particularly accustomed to the convenience of on-the-go and home-delivery consumption
                        Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) records show that about 28,000 tons of waste is collected and delivered to a landfill every month. This represents approximately 40% of the waste generated in the city.  So “ Where does the 60% of the cities waste go?”.  Which is a similar scenario in the 10 recently opened  cities  of Gulu, Arua, Mbarara, Lira, Mbale, Fort Portal, Jinja. The country has a huge challenge of dealing with the overly littered plastic wastes throughout these cities.
                        This has  resulted to not only  increased accumulation of PET plastic in the environment, but has also negatively impacted the environment for example the  degradation of landscapes and blockage of urban canals and rivers. Increased risk of flooding and the emergence of waterborne diseases in stagnant waters are ultimate consequences.
                        A few recycling companies have tried to collect these wastes from the environment but don’t have very effective systems to ensure extensive collection of the plastic waste. They are also selective as they only purchase virgin plastic leaving large quantities of non virgin plastic out in the environment.
                        Many organizations that have tried to arise awareness with in the population with hope of achieving collective action have failed to engage individuals in actively managing their plastic waste.
